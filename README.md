 Project Title: Fake News Detection

Description:
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting fake news articles. With the rise of misinformation and disinformation on the internet,
it's crucial to have tools that can identify and flag potentially deceptive content. The project utilizes a dataset containing labeled examples of fake and real news articles.
Through data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training using logistic regression, the system learns to differentiate between genuine and false information. 
The trained model achieves high accuracy, enabling it to effectively classify news articles as real or fake. Additionally, the project includes a predictive system that 
allows users to input new articles for classification.

Key Features:

Data preprocessing and cleaning techniques
Feature engineering, including text preprocessing and stemming
Model training using logistic regression
Evaluation metrics such as accuracy score
Predictive system for real-time classification of news articles
Technologies Used:

Python
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Jupyter Notebook (for development and experimentation)
GitHub (for version control and project management)
